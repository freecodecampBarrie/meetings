# freeCodeCamp Barrie - Minutes
## January 29, 2021 - Virtual Meeting (Zoom) 7:00 pm - 10:00 pm

This was our first virtual meetup, and was quite a success!

We had approximately 10 attendees (some without video) from different parts of the world besides our local community in Barrie, Ontario Canada.

Chris Naismith covered:
- Quick introduction to Git and Github work flow
- Making an HTML website (using freecodecamp.org curriculum)
- Deploying to Netlify
- Creating a new subnet address redirect and showcase this website
