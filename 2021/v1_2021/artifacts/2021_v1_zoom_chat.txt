01:34:16	Emilie AH-FOCK:	prettier?
01:34:22	Sean Sparling:	Yes.
01:34:28	Emilie AH-FOCK:	its an extension you can install
01:34:53	Emilie AH-FOCK:	if you are vs code on the left hand side
01:34:59	Emilie AH-FOCK:	you can find it in the search bar
01:35:00	Sean Sparling:	Is there a definition of what a div is?
01:35:08	Stephanie Brandon:	If you go to the side bar of VS the very last is the extension that you can search for prettier
01:35:22	Emilie AH-FOCK:	like a section
01:35:53	Sean Sparling:	Ty!
01:35:57	Stephanie Brandon:	Do you mind explaining the difference between a div and a span?
01:36:16	Emilie AH-FOCK:	div  its like grouping if you want
01:37:21	Sean Sparling:	Which one?
01:38:29	Stephanie Brandon:	Thank you

02:01:05	Christopher Cooke:	Heh
02:01:42	Paul Gamble:	Why not Godaddy?
02:04:27	Emilie AH-FOCK:	what is  a CNAME type
02:04:55	Stephanie Brandon:	What does cashing mean?
02:05:22	Chris Naismith:	caching
02:05:47	Emilie AH-FOCK:	it hide your info
02:06:45	Sean Sparling:	Would it be temporarily stored information?
02:06:50	Britney Ming:	Is it something that makes use of RAM?
02:07:24	Sean Sparling:	Thank you.
02:08:27	Britney Ming:	Okay, thank you.
02:13:52	Chris Naismith:	CACHE / CACHING
02:13:59	Chris Naismith:	HASH / HASHING
02:14:18	Sean Sparling:	Like s hash tag?
02:14:23	Stephanie Brandon:	okay that makes more sense, but just so I make sure I fully understand if you update a website and it has a 1 hour cach timing then the site will not have that updated information on the site until the caching checks for changes an hour later and updates?
02:15:02	Christopher Cooke:	Hashing for a quick lookup or reference?
02:15:36	Emilie AH-FOCK:	Hashing?
02:15:39	Stephanie Brandon:	So it is strictly to do with the site name
02:15:43	Stephanie Brandon:	thank you :)
02:16:46	Sean Sparling:	so clearing your cache is forcing it to re examine everything?
02:16:56	Paul Gamble:	Correct
02:18:32	Emilie AH-FOCK:	its like a type I would say. like a write a hash password. it means I am giving it a type with int 100 character
02:21:31	Stephanie Brandon:	Thanks, I followed for most of that 😅
02:21:45	Sean Sparling:	How good are the wings on your website?
02:22:06	Stephanie Brandon:	it also may just be that I am normally in bed by now 😂
02:22:38	Sean Sparling:	On a friday night?
02:23:08	Emilie AH-FOCK:	It recorded :) if you need to go and have work tom t's okay
02:23:31	Christopher Cooke:	a "one way hash function for password" allows you to check a password value without knowing it based on matching hash value.
02:26:42	Emilie AH-FOCK:	batter dying brb
02:27:20	Stephanie Brandon:	Thank you this will now be ingrained into my brain thank. You and your drawing skill makes it more memorable 😂

02:36:03	Tomoya Kuroda:	If we want to update image like logo.jpg on the server, should we rename the file as well to avoid getting old image in terms of cache?
02:40:09	Sean Sparling:	Thank you Emilie and Chris! :D
