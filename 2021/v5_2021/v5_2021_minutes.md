### The Rubber Duck Project - HACKATHON

[Rubberduck repo and details](https://github.com/freecodecampBarrie/rubberduck)

### Covered

We covered a lot of ground as far as what we're trying to create and the Github workflow.

Even created a database cluster and able to connect. [@paulywill](https://github.com/paulywill) struggled with connecting a new cluster (as described in [#1](https://github.com/freecodecampBarrie/rubberduck/issues/1)), so we decided to use one that was already created previously and connect to that one.

Although did not get as far as ambitions hoped for, we did get a good footing for next month's meeting.

In the mean, keep pushing for PRs and merging changes you think are appropriate. Do not worry about breaking anything, that's the point.
