### Suggested Format

Trying to nail down the details on the agenda, but it will obviously be 100% virtual and will include Zoom.
But it will probably be as follow:

- Keynotes / presentations
- Show and Tell
- Hackathon'ish together

Looking for any keynote speakers or those excited to do a bit of show and tell nerdery you've done on the side.
We can all walk through a freecodecamp.org curriculum project together.
Ideally using a collaboration tool, i.e. [repl.it](repl.it) or [VS Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare).

*This is not a promotional event or opportunity to spam the group!*
Zoom bombers will be banned.
Old school IRC rules will apply with moderating. 
Just be cool and kind.
