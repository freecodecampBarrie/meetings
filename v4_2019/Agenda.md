#### Message from "organizer":

I suck.

Yup.

I had organized another meeting, *after* cancelling my Meetup account due to some recent [shenanigans](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-wework-meetup-debacle-and-a-new-chapter/). _THEN_, I forgot an important family thing I have to do that evening (**Oct.25**).

So not only have a created a meeting outside of the Meetup where so many people have found us, I have to flake out and hope my fellow nerds will carry on without me. I know [Brody](https://github.com/bjh) and [Tomoya](https://github.com/tomoyakuroda) will probably be there to help out. ;)

I do apologize and normally would re-schedule for another night, however as promised I kept us the same week as [NorthOT's event](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/northot-barries-largest-tech-meetup-tickets-68883340927), and next Friday is my anniversary.

From this point on I will be setting up events on [EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.ca/d/canada--barrie/freecodecamp/) and will be sharing on our [FB](https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.Barrie.Ontario/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fcc_barrie) page. Once the [Chapter](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/chapter) is working nicely we can use that.

Until next month, code on!
